# Welcome to the TorrentPier Development Blog

We're excited to announce the complete rewrite of TorrentPier using modern web technologies. This blog will document our journey, share development updates, and provide insights into the decisions we make along the way.

<!-- truncate -->

## Why a Rewrite?

The original TorrentPier v2.x served the community well for many years, but technology has evolved significantly. We decided it was time for a complete modernization to:

- Improve security with modern frameworks
- Enhance performance and scalability
- Provide a better user experience
- Make development and customization easier
- Support modern deployment practices

## What's New?

The new TorrentPier is built on:

- **Laravel 12**: The latest version of PHP's most popular framework
- **React 19**: For a dynamic, responsive frontend
- **TypeScript**: Type-safe code for better reliability
- **Inertia.js**: Seamless SPA experience without API complexity
- **Tailwind CSS v4**: Modern, utility-first styling

## What's Next?

We're actively developing core features:

1. User authentication and profiles
2. Torrent upload and management
3. Forum functionality
4. Tracker protocol implementation
5. Admin panel and moderation tools

## Get Involved

This is an open-source project, and we welcome contributions:

- Check our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/torrentpier/torrentpier)
- Read the [documentation](/docs/intro)
- Join discussions on GitHub
- Submit pull requests

Stay tuned for more updates as we build the future of TorrentPier!
