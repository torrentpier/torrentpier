# Forum Repository Interfaces

Repository interfaces for forum aggregates:

- `ForumRepositoryInterface`: Forum aggregate persistence
- `ThreadRepositoryInterface`: Thread aggregate persistence
- `PostRepositoryInterface`: Post queries (read-only)

These interfaces define contracts that infrastructure must implement.
