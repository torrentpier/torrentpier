# Shared Value Objects

Common value objects used across contexts:

- `Id`: Generic identifier base class
- `DateTime`: Immutable datetime wrapper
- `Money`: Monetary value representation
- `Percentage`: Percentage value (0-100)

These are minimal shared concepts that don't violate bounded context principles.
