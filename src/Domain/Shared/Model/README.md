# Shared Domain Models

Base classes and interfaces used across bounded contexts:
- `AggregateRoot`: Base class for all aggregates
- `Entity`: Base class for entities
- `DomainEvent`: Interface for domain events
- `ValueObject`: Base value object interface

These provide common functionality while maintaining context boundaries.
