# Security Policy

## Versions

Due to the nature of our project - being open source - we have decided to patch only the latest major release (currently v2.4.x) for security vulnerabilities.

## How to disclose

Please disclose security issues by mailing [admin@torrentpier.com](mailto:admin@torrentpier.com).

## What we do

Any submitted security issue will be checked thoroughly by our development team. A fix for the issue and a transparent information on GitHub about the issue existing will be released. You can view any previously identified issues on our [GitHub Security Page](https://github.com/torrentpier/torrentpier/security/advisories). New major versions of TorrentPier will also receive a security audit to verify our efforts on providing a secure application.
