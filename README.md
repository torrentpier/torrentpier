php dexter info              # System information
php dexter cache:clear       # Clear caches
php dexter migrate          # Run database migrations
php dexter help <command>   # Command help
```

## ü¶å Laravel Herd Configuration

If you're using [Laravel Herd](https://herd.laravel.com) for local development, you'll need special configuration to properly serve the legacy `/admin/` and `/bt/` directories. By default, Herd routes all requests through the modern front controller, but these directories need to be served directly.

### The Problem

TorrentPier has legacy directories (`/admin/` and `/bt/`) that contain their own `index.php` files and should be processed directly by the web server, not through the Laravel-style routing system. Laravel Herd's default nginx configuration sends all requests to `public/index.php`, which causes these legacy endpoints to fail.

### Solution: Site-Specific Nginx Configuration

#### Step 1: Generate Custom Nginx Config

Run one of these commands to create a site-specific nginx configuration:

```shell
# Option A: Isolate PHP version
herd isolate php@8.4

# Option B: Secure the site with SSL
herd secure
```

This generates a custom nginx configuration file at:
`~/Library/Application\ Support/Herd/config/valet/Nginx/[your-site-name]`

#### Step 2: Edit the Generated Config

Open the generated nginx configuration file and add these location blocks **before** the main Laravel location block:

```nginx
# Serve /admin/ directory directly
location /admin/ {
    alias /path/to/your/torrentpier/admin/;
    index index.php;

    location ~ \.php$ {
        fastcgi_pass unix:/opt/homebrew/var/run/php/php8.4-fpm.sock;
        fastcgi_index index.php;
        fastcgi_param SCRIPT_FILENAME $request_filename;
        include fastcgi_params;
    }
}

# Serve /bt/ directory directly
location /bt/ {
    alias /path/to/your/torrentpier/bt/;
    index index.php;

    location ~ \.php$ {
        fastcgi_pass unix:/opt/homebrew/var/run/php/php8.4-fpm.sock;
        fastcgi_index index.php;
        fastcgi_param SCRIPT_FILENAME $request_filename;
        include fastcgi_params;
    }
}
```

> **Note**: Replace `/path/to/your/torrentpier/` with the actual path to your TorrentPier installation.

#### Step 3: Restart Herd

```shell
herd restart
```

### Alternative Solutions

#### Option 1: Root .htaccess (May work with some Herd configurations)

Create a `.htaccess` file in your project root:

```apache
RewriteEngine On

# Exclude admin and bt directories from Laravel routing
RewriteRule ^admin/ - [L]
RewriteRule ^bt/ - [L]

# Handle everything else through Laravel
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ public/index.php [L]
```

#### Option 2: Move to Public Directory

Move the directories to the public folder:

```shell
mv admin/ public/admin/
mv bt/ public/bt/
```

> **Warning**: This requires updating any hardcoded paths in the legacy code.

### Testing Your Configuration

After applying the configuration, test these URLs:

```shell
# Admin panel should load
curl -I http://your-site.test/admin/

# BitTorrent tracker should respond
curl -I http://your-site.test/bt/

# Announce endpoint should work
curl -I http://your-site.test/bt/announce.php

# Modern routes should still work
curl -I http://your-site.test/hello
```

All should return HTTP 200 status codes.

### Troubleshooting

- **502 Bad Gateway**: Check PHP-FPM socket path in nginx config
- **404 Not Found**: Verify directory paths in nginx location blocks
- **403 Forbidden**: Check file permissions on admin/bt directories
- **Still routing through Laravel**: Ensure location blocks are placed before the main Laravel location block

For more details about Herd nginx configuration, see the [official Herd documentation](https://herd.laravel.com/docs/macos/sites/nginx-configuration).

## üìå Our recommendations

* *It's recommended to run `cron.php`.* - For significant tracker speed increase it may be required to replace the built-in cron.php with an operating system daemon.
* *Local configuration copy.* - You can override the settings using the local configuration file `library/config.local.php`.
