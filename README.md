## üîë Access rights on folders and files

You must provide write permissions to the specified folders:
* `data/avatars`
* `data/uploads`
* `data/uploads/thumbs`
* `internal_data/atom`
* `internal_data/cache`
* `internal_data/log`
* `internal_data/triggers`
* `sitemap`

The specific settings depend on the server you are using, but in general case we recommend chmod 0755 for folders, 
and chmod 0644 for files in them. If you are not sure, leave it as is.

## üìå Our recommendations

* *The recommended way to run cron.php.* - For significant tracker speed increase may be required to replace built-in cron.php by operating system daemon.
* *Local configuration copy.* - You can override the settings using one of these methods: configuration file **library/config.local.php** and the environment
  file **.env**. Both files are created by copying the appropriate .example templates without extension. Local configuration files
  should not be available for reading to anyone by setting up access rights for your web server.
