### Additional steps 👣

## 🔐 Security vulnerabilities

If you discover a security vulnerability within TorrentPier, please follow our [security policy](https://github.com/torrentpier/torrentpier/security/policy), so we can address it promptly.

## 🧪 Testing

TorrentPier includes a comprehensive testing suite built with **Pest PHP**. Run tests to ensure code quality and system reliability:

```shell
# Run all tests
./vendor/bin/pest

# Run with coverage
./vendor/bin/pest --coverage
```

For detailed testing documentation, see [tests/README.md](tests/README.md).

## 📌 Our recommendations

* *It's recommended to run `cron.php`.* - For significant tracker speed increase it may be required to replace the built-in cron.php with an operating system daemon.
* *Local configuration copy.* - You can override the settings using the local configuration file `library/config.local.php`.
