and chmod 0644 for files in them. If you are not sure, leave it as is.

## üìå Our recommendations

* *The recommended way to run cron.php.* - For significant tracker speed increase may be required to replace built-in cron.php by operating system daemon. For more
  information about that you can read [this thread](https://torrentpier.com/threads/52/) on our support forum.
* *Local configuration copy.* - You can override the settings using one of these methods: configuration file **library/config.local.php** and the environment
  file **.env**. Both files are created by copying the appropriate .example templates without extension. Local configuration files
  should not be available for reading to anyone by setting up access rights for your web server.
* *Ocelot installation.* - We have built-in support for alternate compiled announcer ‚Äî Ocelot. The configuration is in the file **library/config.php**,
  the announcer is in the repository [torrentpier/ocelot](https://github.com/torrentpier/ocelot). You can read assembly instructions
  on his repository or in [this thread](https://torrentpier.com/threads/26078/) on our support forum.
* *[TMRR ‚Äî Torrent Merkle Root Reader.](https://github.com/kovalensky/tmrr)* - A tool for extracting, comparing and calculating file hashes for .torrent files, 
  compatible with the BitTorrent v2 protocol. Useful for finding the sources of the same copies of files on different trackers & DHT indexers that support BitTorrent v2 protocol, 
  thus reviving dead torrents, valuable Internet artifacts.
