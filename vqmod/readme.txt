"vQmod"(TM) (aka Virtual Quick Mod) is an innovation modification override method for php.
Instead of modifying actual files to add custom modifications, source files are parsed
"on-the-fly" before the php include() or require() is called.
The source is cloned to a temp file and modifications are made to that temp file, then
substituted for the real file in the include path. The original files are never altered.
